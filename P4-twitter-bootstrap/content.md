Ok, our page renders but it is not very pretty. We can change that without adding any CSS ourselves. We will make use of the [Twitter Bootstrap library](http://getbootstrap.com/). 

#Twitter Bootstrap
This is a popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web that look very modern. It is developed by the team at Twitter and will help us make things look great. 

For this, you should go and read through their [CSS documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/css/). It will show you lots of concepts and classes that will help you make the page look sophisticated and mobile friendly. All without you having to write a line of CSS yourself!

Here are some pointers of classes that will prove very useful. In the App component, you should look at:

* col-md classes
* container
* page-header
* row
* text-center

In the HourForm component, you should look at:

* btn classes
* col-sm classes
* form classes
* panel classes

One thing you need to know for using CSS classes with React is that instead of using the attribute class, you need to use the attribute **className** instead.

#Font Awesome
Once you have finished styling your components, you can also add icons to your page. We've added one to the title for fanciness but you can use the [Font Awesome library](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) anywhere you see fit. They are open source vector icons and have a huge set available. Check out the [documentation](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/) on how they are used.
